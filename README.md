## Gatsby.JS

This portfolio was made with the help of Gatsby JS : https://www.gatsbyjs.org/ .
Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps.
To get started creating websites such as this one : https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/

## My First Website 

I wanted my first website to be simple, elegant, engaging, and informing. GatsbyJS has many templates to choose from, some that
do have blogs incorporated, some that have less information, and many more to fit any users needs.
Down the line, I want to have a blog included in my website, however, I wanted my first one to be simple and easy to maintain.

## Buying and setting up a domain

I reccomend buying domains from Google Domains : https://domains.google/ .
It will show what domains are available and how much they cost.
To set it up: https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3453651?hl=en

If you are using github pages, like myself, and want your own custom domain : https://pages.github.com/ .
